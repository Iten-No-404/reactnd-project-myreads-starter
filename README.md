# MyReads: A Book Tracking App:
To start the website follow the next simple steps:
* Install all project dependencies by writing `npm install` in the terminal at the project directory.
* Start the development server by writing `npm start` in the terminal.
* Go to your favourite browser and type `http://localhost:3000/` in the address bar.
* Browse through the books avaiable in your library and shelves.
* Click on the + button at the bottom right of the screen to search for new or different books to add to your library.

## What You're Getting
* 3 different shelves (`Currently Reading`, `Want to Read` & `Read`) to organize your books into.
* The title, author(s) and cover of each book.  
* Search easily for new books by using the title or the author(s) name.
* Reorganize them easily and at any page(home or search page).
* Syncing your shelves and books to the API, so reloading the page won't make you lose your progress.

This repository is my personal implementation to complete the starter code given by Udacity to _all_ students. I used it for the purpose of learning and advancing my React language skills and fulfilling the project requirement for the MyReads: A Book Tracking App project which is a part of the Advanced Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Program given by Udacity in collaboration with itida.
